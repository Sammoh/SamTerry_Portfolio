4. Origin Shifting (3D or VR)

Construct an environment with player-controlled aircraft navigating a world employing origin shifting.
• Plane Models
    o Download this asset
    o Use the EaglePlane and LightPlane prefabs (not the 1.2 versions)
• World
    o Use a basic Plane mesh 1000x1000 meters
    o Use a tileable world ground texture from here and shift it too
• Flight & Controller
    o No aerodynamic physics required
    o No crashing, no pitch, no roll, yes acceleration
    o Fly at 100 meters in the sky
    o Plane speed is between 50km/h and 500km/h
    o Up / Down arrows adjust speed (think throttle not gas pedal)
    o Left / Right arrows adjust yaw
    o Place the camera in the position displayed
• Second Plane
    o Press space to spawn the other aircraft 10 meters in front of your aircraft traveling at
your speed
    o Press enter to change planes, the plane you left continues flying
• GUI
    o Display debug info: speed, position, shifted position
    o Display a mini map showing north
    o Display the other plane on the mini map when it is in and out of range
